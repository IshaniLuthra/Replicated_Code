		<p align = "center"><b>The Phantom Destroyer! Here's a page that uses all of the HTML concepts I know of made in honour of my favourite jet fighter! I'll be making moe of these project sites as I'll be mastering more technologies, one by one.</b></p>

		<p align = "center">MiG stands for Mikoyan Gurevich, who were the two principle designers of this aircraft. It incorporates a unique delta wing configuration along with standard hrizontal stabilizers. It is a Mach 2 capable fighter aircraft that was designed by the MiG design bureau in Soviet Union. By its capabilities, it soon became the premier 2nd generation fighter aircraft and even now, after more than 50 years of it's induction in Soviet Air Force, it still serves in many countries, like the one I'm a native of, India.</p>
